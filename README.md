# Geo-paw-sitioning

Hi ifoHack 2023 Jury, staff, and participants! :wave: <br>
Welcome to our land price prediction repository, Geo-paw-sitioning :cat2: <br> 
We use machine learning (random forests) to predict land prices based on
socio-economic factors, land types, and neighborhood-network analysis. Our platform 
helps decision-makers in real estate, agriculture, and land-use planning to make 
informed choices. We'd love your feedback and collaboration to improve our models!
