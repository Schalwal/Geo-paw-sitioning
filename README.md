# Geo-paw-sitioning

Hi ifoHack 2023 Jury, staff, and participants! :wave:
Welcome to our land price prediction repository, Geo-paw-sitioning :cat2: We use machine 
learning to predict land prices based on socio-economic factors. Our platform helps 
decision-makers in real estate, agriculture, and land-use planning to make informed 
choices. We'd love your feedback and collaboration to improve our models!

## Which features we used and how we found them

- Total distance of different edge types in each neighborhood:
    For each neighborhood we use the total length of different kinds of paths such as total length of roads,
    walking lanes, cycling lanes and others ['drive', 'bike', 'walk', 'drive_service', 'all', 'all_private']
